# Question:
# You are given a matrix of 0s, 1s, and 2s, where 0 means an empty cell, 1 means a wall, and 2 means an exit. There will always be an exit. Generate a sequence of instructions (U, D, L, R) such that no matter where you start in the matrix, you always reach the exit.
# Example:


# 1 0 1  
# 0 2 0  
# 1 0 1  
# Answer: UDLR (No matter where you start, youâ€™ll end up at 2).
