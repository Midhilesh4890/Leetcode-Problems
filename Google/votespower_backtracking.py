# You are given a list of vote power and states


# votesPower = [1,5,7,8,9,10,20]
# states = ["California", "Texas", "Florida", "Indiana", "Alaska", "Ohio", "Hawaii"]


# And you have two candidates C1 and C2, you need to return a List of List of states that we can make in such an order that both candidates receive the same amount of votes.


# Example: [["California", "Texas", "Florida", "Indiana", "Alaska"], ["Ohio", "Hawaii"]]
# The list can have different combinations, you need to return all the lists of combinations.


# What would be the optimal solution for this problem?
